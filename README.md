# ZERO TO HERO
### I am bad...
Objectively, I am poor at Leetcode/Interview style problems. I've spent the last few years of my CS career focusing on courses, jobs/internships, and building personal projects. During this time I have neglected an absolutely crucial aspect of programming - puzzles (lmao). Over the course of several interview assessments, I have been brutally humbled by what would be deemed simple interview questions among Leetcode's elites. The first step to solving any problem, is admitting that it exists - I am bad at Leetcode/Interview questions.

### I will be good!
Over the coming weeks, months, or even years if it takes that long, I will dish out a monumental effort towards improve my Leetcoding skills. I will go from struggling with Leetcode easy's to absolutely steam-rolling Leetcode medium's and hard's. The plan is to do the following EVERY SINGLE DAY:
* Complete and understand one Leetcode problem
* Document the approach to each problem for better understanding
* Accompany my practice with [reading](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf) 

### The goal.
Although Leetcode questions are a barrier for entry on lots of software engineering jobs, my goal for this repository does not stop there. Within 1 year's time (06/28/2023), my skills will have improved to the point where I can win Leetcode Weekly AND Leetcode Biweekly.
